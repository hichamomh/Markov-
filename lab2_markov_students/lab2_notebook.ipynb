    "- **codes without any explanations (in a text cell) will not be considered as a complete answer**, and will only be attributed a fraction opf the grade attributed to the question.\n",
    "- any code produced should be commented whenever appropriate;\n",
    "- include appropriate axis labels and a relevant title to each figure reported in the notebook;\n",
    "- **document any function you introduce (using docstrings)**, and comment your code whenever appropriate (see, *e.g.*, [PEP 8 style recommendations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)). \n",
    "     - use a reference docstring style, *e.g.*, the [google docstring style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).\n",
